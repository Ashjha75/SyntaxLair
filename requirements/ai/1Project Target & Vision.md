# 1. Project Target & Vision

## Objective
Define the primary purpose and goals of the developer-focused note-taking browser extension that combines the organizational style of Notion with the server/channel structure of Discord, optimized for programmers.

## Target Users
- Software developers
- Programmers who need structured note-taking with code support
- Users who prefer developer-centric UI and workflows
- Users requiring offline-first storage with scalable syncing options

## Problem Statement
Identify the pain points in existing note-taking tools for developers:
- Lack of organized server/channel style workspace
- Poor code snippet management and syntax highlighting
- Limited offline capabilities and local storage options
- Insufficient keyboard navigation and shortcuts for power users

## Vision
Build a lightweight, extensible, and user-friendly browser extension that:
- Provides an intuitive, developer-friendly interface
- Supports Markdown and syntax-highlighted code snippets
- Organizes notes via servers and channels for easy navigation
- Stores data locally by default with options to scale to cloud sync
- Enhances productivity with keyboard shortcuts and search

## Success Criteria
- Seamless note creation and organization by servers and channels
- Fast, responsive UI optimized for developer workflows
- Reliable local storage with a clear path for scalable syncing
- Positive user feedback from developers during testing phases
